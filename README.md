# News-Headline-Classification
A Team Project for a graduate level NLP class

# Project Description:
Due to the development of technology, the dissemination and collection of information have become very easy, especially for news stories of all kinds. Now every news media has its website, and we can easily collect all kinds of news articles from these websites. Even ordinary people can write their news articles on some public websites. When faced with these large numbers of news articles, quickly categorizing them and finding the articles we need becomes particularly important. Since most essays have a high amount of text, it is time-consuming and resource-intensive to analyze the entire article directly. Therefore, people turn their attention from the article as a whole to the introduction of the article. But short text classification is a challenging task because there are several words in each text, usually less than 20 words, which brings about the problem of feature sparseness. We want to use a neural network to create an NLP model that can achieve excellent performance on the news headline classification task.
